# E-commerce-Sales-Analysis-Hackathon
I designed this hackathon to empower learners with hands-on experience in data analysis using tools like Excel, SQL, Python, and Power BI. Leaners will analyze an E-commerce Sales and Customer Insights Dataset to uncover trends, answer key business questions, and create actionable insights.
